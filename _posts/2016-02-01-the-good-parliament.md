This print of Portcullis House was originally commissioned by the Houses of Parliament to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012. It has subsequently&nbsp; been used for the cover of Professor Sarah Childs' book, "The Good Parliament".&nbsp;

A copy of the print remains in the [Parliamentary Collection](https://old.parliament.uk/about/art-in-parliament/news/2012/tobias-till/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
